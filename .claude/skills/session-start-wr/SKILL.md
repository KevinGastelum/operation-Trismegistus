description: Bootstrap a fresh Warren-driven Claude Code session — rehydrate from CLAUDE.md, memory, docs/HANDOFF.md, the task list, and git; run the Warren pre-flight; resume any in-flight runs; and present where-we-are + next + blockers. TRIGGER at the start of a session continuing prior Warren work.

# session-start-wr

Rehydrate from durable artifacts (do NOT rely on recalling a prior conversation). Do ALL of:

1. **Read** — CLAUDE.md, the `session-handoff` memory (+ linked Warren memories), `docs/HANDOFF.md`, and the TaskList.
2. **Git** — `git fetch origin`; `git log --oneline -5`; fast-forward local `main` to `origin/main` if behind; `git status`.
3. **Warren pre-flight** — `bash scripts/wr-health.sh`; export WARREN_API_TOKEN (sed from warren .env, never echo); `bash scripts/wr-projects.sh`; confirm the project id.
4. **Resume in-flight runs** — for any run IDs in the handoff not yet verified+merged, poll GET /runs/{id}; when terminal, verify locally (uv + pytest in a worktree, confirm NO sandbox-runtime junk in the diff) and auto-merge per the CLAUDE.md merge policy.
5. **Surface** — a crisp summary: what's done · the immediate next task · blockers/human-action items · backlog.
6. Proceed with the next task (or ask the human if a decision is pending).
